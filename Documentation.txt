To construct a recursive descent parser, ambiguity must be removed from the CFG for the toy language:

Program ::= Assignment*

Assignment ::= Identifier = Exp;

Exp ::= Term Exp'

Exp' ::= + Term Exp' | - Term Exp' | null

Term ::= Fact Term'

Term' ::= * Fact Term' | null

Fact ::= ( Exp ) | - Fact | + Fact | Literal | Identifier

Identifier ::= Letter [Letter | Digit]*

Letter ::= a|...|z|A|...|Z|_

Literal ::= 0 | [1-9] [0-9]*
